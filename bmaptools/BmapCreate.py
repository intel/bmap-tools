This module implements the block map (bmap) creation functionality and provides
the corresponding API in form of the 'BmapCreate' class.

The idea is that while images files may generally be very large (e.g., 4GiB),
they may nevertheless contain only little real data, e.g., 512MiB. This data
are files, directories, file-system meta-data, partition table, etc. When
copying the image to the target device, you do not have to copy all the 4GiB of
data, you can copy only 512MiB of it, which is 4 times less, so copying should
presumably be 4 times faster.

The block map file is an XML file which contains a list of blocks which have to
be copied to the target device. The other blocks are not used and there is no
need to copy them. The XML file also contains some additional information like
block size, image size, count of mapped blocks, etc. There are also many
commentaries, so it is human-readable.

The image has to be a sparse file. Generally, this means that when you generate
this image file, you should start with a huge sparse file which contains a
single hole spanning the entire file. Then you should partition it, write all
the data (probably by means of loop-back mounting the image or parts of it),
etc. The end result should be a sparse file where mapped areas represent useful
parts of the image and holes represent useless parts of the image, which do not
have to be copied when copying the image to the target device.

This module uses the FIEMAP ioctl to detect holes.

# The bmap format version we generate.
#
# Changelog:
# o 1.3 -> 2.0:
#   Support SHA256 and SHA512 checksums, in 1.3 only SHA1 was supported.
#   "BmapFileChecksum" is used instead of "BmapFileSHA1", and "chksum="
#   attribute is used instead "sha1=". Introduced "ChecksumType" tag. This is
#   an incompatible change.
#   Note, bmap format 1.4 is identical to 2.0. Version 1.4 was a mistake,
#   instead of incrementing the major version number, we incremented minor
#   version number. Unfortunately, the mistake slipped into bmap-tools version
#   3.0, and was only fixed in bmap-tools v3.1.

<!-- This file contains the block map for an image file, which is basically
     a list of useful (mapped) block numbers in the image file. In other words,
     it lists only those blocks which contain data (boot sector, partition
     table, file-system metadata, files, directories, extents, etc). These
     blocks have to be copied to the target device. The other blocks do not
     contain any useful data and do not have to be copied to the target
     device.

     The block map an optimization which allows to copy or flash the image to
     the image quicker than copying of flashing the entire image. This is
     because with bmap less data is copied: <MappedBlocksCount> blocks instead
     of <BlocksCount> blocks.

     Besides the machine-readable data, this file contains useful commentaries
     which contain human-readable information like image size, percentage of
     mapped data, etc.

     The 'version' attribute is the block map file format version in the
     'major.minor' format. The version major number is increased whenever an
     incompatible block map format change is made. The minor number changes
     in case of minor backward-compatible changes. -->
