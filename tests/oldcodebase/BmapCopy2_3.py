""" This module implements copying of images with bmap and provides the
following API.
  1. BmapCopy class - implements copying to any kind of file, be that a block
     device or a regular file.
  2. BmapBdevCopy class - based on BmapCopy and specializes on copying to block
     devices. It does some more sanity checks and some block device performance
     tuning.

The bmap file is an XML file which contains a list of mapped blocks of the
image. Mapped blocks are the blocks which have disk sectors associated with
them, as opposed to holes, which are blocks with no associated disk sectors. In
other words, the image is considered to be a sparse file, and bmap basically
contains a list of mapped blocks of this sparse file. The bmap additionally
contains some useful information like block size (usually 4KiB), image size,
mapped blocks count, etc.

The bmap is used for copying the image to a block device or to a regular file.
The idea is that we copy quickly with bmap because we copy only mapped blocks
and ignore the holes, because they are useless. And if the image is generated
properly (starting with a huge hole and writing all the data), it usually
contains only little mapped blocks, comparing to the overall image size. And
such an image compresses very well (because holes are read as all zeroes), so
it is beneficial to distributor them as compressed files along with the bmap.

Here is an example. Suppose you have a 4GiB image which contains only 100MiB of
user data and you need to flash it to a slow USB stick. With bmap you end up
copying only a little bit more than 100MiB of data from the image to the USB
stick (namely, you copy only mapped blocks). This is a lot faster than copying
all 4GiB of data. We say that it is a bit more than 100MiB because things like
file-system meta-data (inode tables, superblocks, etc), partition table, etc
also contribute to the mapped blocks and are also copied. """

    """This class implements the bmap-based copying functionality. To copy an
    image with bmap you should create an instance of this class, which requires
    the following:

    * full path or a file-like object of the image to copy
    * full path or a file object of the destination file copy the image to
    * full path or a file object of the bmap file (optional)
    * image size in bytes (optional)

    Although the main purpose of this class is to use bmap, the bmap is not
    required, and if it was not provided then the entire image will be copied
    to the destination file.

    When the bmap is provided, it is not necessary to specify image size,
    because the size is contained in the bmap. Otherwise, it is benefitial to
    specify the size because it enables extra sanity checks and makes it
    possible to provide the progress bar.

    When the image size is known either from the bmap or the caller specified
    it to the class constructor, all the image geometry description attributes
    ('blocks_cnt', etc) are initialized by the class constructor and available
    for the user.

    However, when the size is not known, some of  the image geometry
    description attributes are not initialized by the class constructor.
    Instead, they are initialized only by the 'copy()' method.

    The 'copy()' method implements image copying. You may choose whether to
    verify the SHA1 checksum while copying or not. Note, this is done only in
    case of bmap-based copying and only if bmap contains the SHA1 checksums
    (e.g., bmap version 1.0 did not have SHA1 checksums).

    You may choose whether to synchronize the destination file after writing or
    not. To explicitly synchronize it, use the 'sync()' method.

    This class supports all the bmap format versions up version
    'SUPPORTED_BMAP_VERSION'.

    It is possible to have a simple progress indicator while copying the image.
    Use the 'set_progress_indicator()' method.

    You can copy only once with an instance of this class. This means that in
    order to copy the image for the second time, you have to create a new class
    instance."""
