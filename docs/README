Summary
~~~~~~~

The bmap-tools project implements bmap-related tools and API modules. The
entire project is written in python, and requires python 2.7+.

Currently the main user of this project is Tizen IVI, but the project is
generic and can be used everywhere, when dealing with raw images.

The project author and maintainer is Artem Bityutskiy <dedekind1@gmail.com>.

The project structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| - bmaptool             | A tools to create bmap and copy with bmap. Based    |
|                        | on the 'BmapCreate.py' and 'BmapCopy.py' modules.   |
| - setup.py             | A script to turn the entire bmap-tools project      |
|                        | into a python egg.                                  |
| - setup.cfg            | contains a piece of nose tests configuration        |
| - .coveragerc          | lists files to include into test coverage report    |
| - TODO                 | Just a list of things to be done for the project.   |
| - make_a_release.sh    | Most people may ignore this script. It is used by   |
|                        | maintainer when creating a new release.
| - tests/               | Contains the project unit-tests.                    |
|   | - test_api_base.py | Tests the base API modules: 'BmapCreate.py' and     |
|   |                    | 'BmapCopy.py'.                                      |
|   | - test_fiemap.py   | Tests the 'Fiemap.py' module.                       |
|   | - helpers.py       | Helper functions shared between the unit-tests.     |
| - bmaptools/           | The API modules which implement all the bmap        |
|   |                    | functionality.                                      |
|   | - BmapCreate.py    | Creates a bmap for a given file.                    |
|   | - BmapCopy.py      | Implements copying of an image using its bmap.      |
|   | - Fiemap.py        | Implements python API to the Linux FIEMAP ioctl.    |
|   | - BmapHelpers.py   | Just helper functions used all over the project.    |
|   | - TransRead.py     | Provides a transparent way to read various kind of  |
|   |                    | files (compressed, etc)                             |
| - debian/*             | Debian packaging for the project.                   |
| - packaging/*          | RPM packaging (Fedora & OpenSuse) for the project.  |

How to run unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just install the 'nose' python test framework and run the 'nosetests' command in
the project root directory. If you want to see tests coverage report, run
'nosetests --with-coverage'.

Branches and releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project uses the following git branches:
  1. devel - here we do all the development, so this branch contains the latest
     code. Things may be broken in this branch, although we do not commit
     anything before it passes the unit-tests. But of course, the unit-tests
     have limited coverage. Anyway, do not use this branch unless you are a
     developer or you know what you are doing.
  2. master - we do not use this branch for anything but pointing to the latest
     release. This means that you may safely take this branch and be sure this
     is the latest stable code.
  3. release-x.0 - pre-releases or releases or bug-fix releases of version "x".

Let's take an example. When we start developing the 'bmap-tools' project from
scratch, and have the first version 1.0-rc1 which somehow works, we create the
'release-1.0' branch. The idea is that this branch will eventually contain the
first bmap-tools release version 1.0. But at the moment it contains the
pre-release version 0.1. As we move forward, we cut pre-releases
1.0-rc2, 1.0-rc3..., 1.0-rc7, and so on. They are all published in the
'release-1.0' branch. And of course, the 'master' branch points to the latest
release (same as release candidate, rc).

Then at some point we finally release the first 'bmap-tools' version 1.0. No
more features are added to the 1.0 release. At the same time we continue
developing in the 'devel' branch and add major features for the next '2.0'
release. We create the 'release-2.0' branch, and publish 2.0 pre-releases
there: 2.0-rc1, 2.0-rc2, etc.

Meanwhile, users report brown-paperbag flaws in bmap-tools-1.0. We fix the
issues, and publish bug-fix releases: 1.1, 1.2, etc. They are also published in
the 'release-1.0' branch. The 'master' branch points to the latest 2.0
release, though.
