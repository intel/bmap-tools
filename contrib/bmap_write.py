#!/usr/bin/python

# A super-simple standalone script (works with both Python2 / Python3 and has
# no external dependencies) to show how easily .bmap files can be parsed.
# (Also demonstrates how little code it takes - which might be a useful starting
# point for other languages)
#
# This is effectively a minimal version of 'bmaptool copy'. It only supports
# uncompressed images, it does no verification, and if the image is named
# mydata.img it assumes the corresponding bmap is named mydata.bmap
