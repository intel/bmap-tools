Current TODO list, any help with these is appreciated.

1. Teach bmaptool to update the alternate GPT partition
2. Add a test for bmap with invalid checksums
3. When writing to a file, and the file did not exist, so we create it,
   and then fail, we do not remove the half-written file.
4. Implement adaptive decompression buffer size.
